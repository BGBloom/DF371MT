Lack of Authentication in the FTP Server for the Windows Box on Port 21 grants access to any user/password combination.
The directory of the webserver on the windows machine needs to be cleaned up so that only information watned to be public is availble to be navigated to. 
Xitami configuration files are stored in plaintext and so are the passwords
Xitami configuration files are able to be modified by JOE
CVE-2009-3672 - Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 does not properly handle objects in memory that (1) were not properly initialized or (2) are deleted, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a call to the getElementsByTagName method for the STYLE tag name, selection of the single element in the returned list, and a change to the outerHTML property of this element, related to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and mshtml.dll, aka "HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
CVE-2009-2069 - Microsoft Internet Explorer before 8 displays a cached certificate for a (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT response page returned by a proxy server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof an arbitrary https site by letting a browser obtain a valid certificate from this site during one request, and then sending the browser a crafted 502 response page upon a subsequent request.
CVE-2009-2057 - Microsoft Internet Explorer before 8 uses the HTTP Host header to determine the context of a document provided in a (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT response from a proxy server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary web script by modifying this CONNECT response, aka an "SSL tampering" attack.
CVE-2007-5347 - Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 through 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via "unexpected method calls to HTML objects," aka "DHTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
CVE-2007-5344 - Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 through 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted website using Javascript that creates, modifies, deletes, and accesses document objects using the tags property, which triggers heap corruption, related to uninitialized or deleted objects, a different issue than CVE-2007-3902 and CVE-2007-3903, and a variant of "Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
CVE-2007-4848 -Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 through 7 allows remote attackers to determine the existence of local files that have associated images via a res:// URI in the src property of a JavaScript Image object, as demonstrated by the URI for a bitmap image resource within a (1) .exe or (2) .dll file.
CVE-2007-3903 -Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via uninitialized or deleted objects used in repeated calls to the (1) cloneNode or (2) nodeValue JavaScript function, a different issue than CVE-2007-3902 and CVE-2007-5344, a variant of "Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
CVE-2007-3902 - Use-after-free vulnerability in the CRecalcProperty function in mshtml.dll in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 through 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by calling the setExpression method and then modifying the outerHTML property of an HTML element, one variant of "Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
CVE-2007-3550 -  Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and 7.0 allows remote attackers to fill Zones with arbitrary domains using certain metacharacters such as wildcards via JavaScript, which results in a denial of service (website suppression and resource consumption), aka "Internet Explorer Zone Domain Specification Dos and Page Suppressing". NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the zone settings cannot be manipulated.
CVE-2007-0943 - Unspecified vulnerability in Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6 SP1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) strings that trigger memory corruption during parsing, related to use of out-of-bounds pointers.
CVE-2007-0612 - Multiple ActiveX controls in Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003, and Vista allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (Internet Explorer crash) by accessing the bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, alinkColor, vlinkColor, or defaultCharset properties in the (1) giffile, (2) htmlfile, (3) jpegfile, (4) mhtmlfile, (5) ODCfile, (6) pjpegfile, (7) pngfile, (8) xbmfile, (9) xmlfile, (10) xslfile, or (11) wdfile objects in (a) mshtml.dll; or the (12) TriEditDocument.TriEditDocument or (13) TriEditDocument.TriEditDocument.1 objects in (b) triedit.dll, which cause a NULL pointer dereference.
CVE-2006-7065 - Microsoft Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an IFRAME with a certain XML file and XSL stylesheet that triggers a crash in mshtml.dll when a refresh is called, probably a null pointer dereference.
CVE-2006-4777 - Heap-based buffer overflow in the DirectAnimation Path Control (DirectAnimation.PathControl) COM object (daxctle.ocx) for Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1, on Chinese and possibly other Windows distributions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown manipulations in arguments to the KeyFrame method, possibly related to an integer overflow, as demonstrated by daxctle2, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-4446.
CVE-2006-4495 - Microsoft Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code by instantiating certain Windows 2000 ActiveX COM Objects including (1) ciodm.dll, (2) myinfo.dll, (3) msdxm.ocx, and (4) creator.dll.
CVE-2006-4446 - Heap-based buffer overflow in DirectAnimation.PathControl COM object (daxctle.ocx) in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Spline function call whose first argument specifies a large number of points.
CVE-2006-4301 - Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long Color attribute in multiple DirectX Media Image DirectX Transforms ActiveX COM Objects from (a) dxtmsft.dll and (b) dxtmsft3.dll, including (1) DXImageTransform.Microsoft.MaskFilter.1, (2) DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Chroma.1, and (3) DX3DTransform.Microsoft.Shapes.1.
