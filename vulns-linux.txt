CVE-2008-1948, CVE-2008-1949, CVE-2008-1950 - Multiple flaws were discovered in the connection handling of GnuTLS. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash applications linked against GnuTLS, or possibly execute arbitrary code with permissions of the application's user.

#Port 22 Vulnerabilities for OPENSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
CVE-2007-4752 - SSH in OpenSSH before 4.7 does not properly handle when an untrusted cookie cannot be created and uses a trusted X11 cookie instead, which allows attackers to violate intended policy and gain privileges by causing an X client to be treated as trusted. 
CVE-2010-4478 - When J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
CVE-2008-1657 - OpenSSH 4.4 up to versions before 4.9 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the sshd_config ForceCommand directive by modifying the .ssh/rc session file.
CVE-2010-5107 - The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP connections.
CVE-2012-0814 - The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite. NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
CVE-2011-5000 - The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field. NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
CVE-2008-5161 - Error handling in the SSH protocol in (1) SSH Tectia Client and Server and Connector 4.0 through 4.4.11, 5.0 through 5.2.4, and 5.3 through 5.3.8; Client and Server and ConnectSecure 6.0 through 6.0.4; Server for Linux on IBM System z 6.0.4; Server for IBM z/OS 5.5.1 and earlier, 6.0.0, and 6.0.1; and Client 4.0-J through 4.3.3-J and 4.0-K through 4.3.10-K; and (2) OpenSSH 4.7p1 and possibly other versions, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors.
CVE-2011-4327 - ssh-keysign.c in ssh-keysign in OpenSSH before 5.8p2 on certain platforms executes ssh-rand-helper with unintended open file descriptors, which allows local users to obtain sensitive key information via the ptrace system call.
CVE-2008-3259 - OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.
CVE-2014-6271 - (A.K.A. ShellShock) The remote host is running a version of Bash that is vulnerable to command injection via environment variable manipulation. Depending on the configuration of the system, an attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code.

#Port 53 vulnerabilities for ISC BIND 9.4.2
CVE-2012-1667 - SC BIND 9.4.2 does not properly handle resource records with a zero-length RDATA section, which allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or data corruption) or obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted record.
CVE-2012-3817 - When DNSSEC validation is enabled, does not properly initialize the failing-query cache, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) by sending many queries.
CVE-2014-8500 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 does not limit delegation chaining, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and named crash) via a large or infinite number of referrals.
CVE-2012-5166 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (named daemon hang) via unspecified combinations of resource records.
CVE-2012-4244 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named daemon exit) via a query for a long resource record.
CVE-2008-4163 - Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9.4.2 on Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (UDP client handler termination) via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0382 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 handles out-of-bailiwick data accompanying a secure response without re-fetching from the original source, which allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted response, aka Bug 20819. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a regression during the fix for CVE-2009-4022.
CVE-2017-3141 - The BIND installer on Windows uses an unquoted service path which can enable a local user to achieve privilege escalation if the host file system permissions allow this.
