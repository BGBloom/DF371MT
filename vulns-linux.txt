CVE-2008-1948, CVE-2008-1949, CVE-2008-1950 - Multiple flaws were discovered in the connection handling of GnuTLS. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash applications linked against GnuTLS, or possibly execute arbitrary code with permissions of the application's user.

#Port 22 Vulnerabilities for OPENSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
CVE-2007-4752 - SSH in OpenSSH before 4.7 does not properly handle when an untrusted cookie cannot be created and uses a trusted X11 cookie instead, which allows attackers to violate intended policy and gain privileges by causing an X client to be treated as trusted. 
CVE-2010-4478 - When J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
CVE-2008-1657 - OpenSSH 4.4 up to versions before 4.9 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the sshd_config ForceCommand directive by modifying the .ssh/rc session file.
CVE-2010-5107 - The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP connections.
CVE-2012-0814 - The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite. NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
CVE-2011-5000 - The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field. NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
CVE-2008-5161 - Error handling in the SSH protocol in (1) SSH Tectia Client and Server and Connector 4.0 through 4.4.11, 5.0 through 5.2.4, and 5.3 through 5.3.8; Client and Server and ConnectSecure 6.0 through 6.0.4; Server for Linux on IBM System z 6.0.4; Server for IBM z/OS 5.5.1 and earlier, 6.0.0, and 6.0.1; and Client 4.0-J through 4.3.3-J and 4.0-K through 4.3.10-K; and (2) OpenSSH 4.7p1 and possibly other versions, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors.
CVE-2011-4327 - ssh-keysign.c in ssh-keysign in OpenSSH before 5.8p2 on certain platforms executes ssh-rand-helper with unintended open file descriptors, which allows local users to obtain sensitive key information via the ptrace system call.
CVE-2008-3259 - OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.
CVE-2014-6271 - (A.K.A. ShellShock) The remote host is running a version of Bash that is vulnerable to command injection via environment variable manipulation. Depending on the configuration of the system, an attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code.

#Port 53 vulnerabilities for ISC BIND 9.4.2
CVE-2012-1667 - SC BIND 9.4.2 does not properly handle resource records with a zero-length RDATA section, which allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or data corruption) or obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted record.
CVE-2012-3817 - When DNSSEC validation is enabled, does not properly initialize the failing-query cache, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) by sending many queries.
CVE-2014-8500 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 does not limit delegation chaining, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and named crash) via a large or infinite number of referrals.
CVE-2012-5166 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (named daemon hang) via unspecified combinations of resource records.
CVE-2008-4163 - Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9.4.2 on Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (UDP client handler termination) via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0382 - ISC BIND 9.4.2 handles out-of-bailiwick data accompanying a secure response without re-fetching from the original source, which allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted response, aka Bug 20819. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a regression during the fix for CVE-2009-4022.
CVE-2017-3141 - The BIND installer on Windows uses an unquoted service path which can enable a local user to achieve privilege escalation if the host file system permissions allow this.
CVE-2015-8461 - Race condition in resolver.c in named in ISC BIND 9.9.8 before 9.9.8-P2 and 9.10.3 before 9.10.3-P2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (INSIST assertion failure and daemon exit) via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2021-2216 - In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.
CVE-2015-8704 - apl_42.c in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.8-P3, 9.9.x, and 9.10.x before 9.10.3-P3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (INSIST assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed Address Prefix List (APL) record.
CVE-2009-0025 - BIND 9.6.0, 9.5.1, 9.5.0, 9.4.3, and earlier does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL DSA_verify function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.
CVE-2015-8705 - buffer.c in named in ISC BIND 9.10.x before 9.10.3-P3, when debug logging is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit, or daemon crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via (1) OPT data or (2) an ECS option.
CVE-2010-3614 - named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.6.2-P3, 9.7.x before 9.7.2-P3, 9.4-ESV before 9.4-ESV-R4, and 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R3 does not properly determine the security status of an NS RRset during a DNSKEY algorithm rollover, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DNSSEC validation error) by triggering a rollover.
CVE-2021-25219 - In BIND 9.3.0 -> 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.35-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.21-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.18 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, exploitation of broken authoritative servers using a flaw in response processing can cause degradation in BIND resolver performance. The way the lame cache is currently designed makes it possible for its internal data structures to grow almost infinitely, which may cause significant delays in client query processing.
CVE-2021-25215 - In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a query for a record triggering the flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other versions of BIND 9.
CVE-2020-8616 - A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals can, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process the referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.
CVE-2017-3145 - BIND was improperly sequencing cleanup operations on upstream recursion fetch contexts, leading in some cases to a use-after-free error that can trigger an assertion failure and crash in named. Affects BIND 9.0.0 to 9.8.x, 9.9.0 to 9.9.11, 9.10.0 to 9.10.6, 9.11.0 to 9.11.2, 9.9.3-S1 to 9.9.11-S1, 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.6-S1, 9.12.0a1 to 9.12.0rc1.
CVE-2016-9444 - named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.9-P5, 9.10.x before 9.10.4-P5, and 9.11.x before 9.11.0-P2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a crafted DS resource record in an answer.
CVE-2016-9131 - named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.9-P5, 9.10.x before 9.10.4-P5, and 9.11.x before 9.11.0-P2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed response to an RTYPE ANY query.
CVE-2016-8864 - named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.9-P4, 9.10.x before 9.10.4-P4, and 9.11.x before 9.11.0-P1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a DNAME record in the answer section of a response to a recursive query, related to db.c and resolver.c.
CVE-2016-2848 - ISC BIND 9.1.0 through 9.8.4-P2 and 9.9.0 through 9.9.2-P2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via malformed options data in an OPT resource record.
CVE-2016-1286 - named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.8-P4 and 9.10.x before 9.10.3-P4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a crafted signature record for a DNAME record, related to db.c and resolver.c.
CVE-2015-8000 - db.c in named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.8-P2 and 9.10.x before 9.10.3-P2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed class attribute.
CVE-2012-1033 - The resolver in ISC BIND 9 through 9.8.1-P1 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a “ghost domain names” attack.
CVE-2011-4313 - query.c in ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.6.x, 9.4-ESV through 9.4-ESV-R5, 9.6-ESV through 9.6-ESV-R5, 9.7.0 through 9.7.4, 9.8.0 through 9.8.1, and 9.9.0a1 through 9.9.0b1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named exit) via unknown vectors related to recursive DNS queries, error logging, and the caching of an invalid record by the resolver.
CVE-2011-1910 - Off-by-one error in named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.7.3-P1, 9.8.x before 9.8.0-P2, 9.4-ESV before 9.4-ESV-R4-P1, and 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R4-P1 allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a negative response containing large RRSIG RRsets.
CVE-2009-0265 - Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) BIND 9.6.0 and earlier does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077 and CVE-2009-0025.
CVE-2020-8617 - Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.
CVE-2017-3143 - An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update. Affects BIND 9.4.0->9.8.8, 9.9.0->9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0->9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0->9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1->9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1->9.10.5-S2.
CVE-2017-3142 - An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into: providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient or accepting bogus NOTIFY packets. Affects BIND 9.4.0->9.8.8, 9.9.0->9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0->9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0->9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1->9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1->9.10.5-S2.
CVE-2016-2775 - ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.9-P2, 9.10.x before 9.10.4-P2, and 9.11.x before 9.11.0b2, when lwresd or the named lwres option is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long request that uses the lightweight resolver protocol.
CVE-2016-1285 - named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.8-P4 and 9.10.x before 9.10.3-P4 does not properly handle DNAME records when parsing fetch reply messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed packet to the rndc (aka control channel) interface, related to alist.c and sexpr.c.
CVE-2010-0097 - ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.3.x, 9.4 before 9.4.3-P5, 9.5 before 9.5.2-P2, 9.6 before 9.6.1-P3, and 9.7.0 beta does not properly validate DNSSEC (1) NSEC and (2) NSEC3 records, which allows remote attackers to add the Authenticated Data (AD) flag to a forged NXDOMAIN response for an existing domain.
CVE-2009-0696 - The dns_db_findrdataset function in db.c in named in ISC BIND 9.4 before 9.4.3-P3, 9.5 before 9.5.1-P3, and 9.6 before 9.6.1-P1, when configured as a master server, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via an ANY record in the prerequisite section of a crafted dynamic update message, as exploited in the wild in July 2009.
CVE-2020-8622 - In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3, also affects 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker on the network path for a TSIG-signed request, or operating the server receiving the TSIG-signed request, could send a truncated response to that request, triggering an assertion failure, causing the server to exit. Alternately, an off-path attacker would have to correctly guess when a TSIG-signed request was sent, along with other characteristics of the packet and message, and spoof a truncated response to trigger an assertion failure, causing the server to exit.
CVE-2016-6170 - ISC BIND through 9.9.9-P1, 9.10.x through 9.10.4-P1, and 9.11.x through 9.11.0b1 allows primary DNS servers to cause a denial of service (secondary DNS server crash) via a large AXFR response, and possibly allows IXFR servers to cause a denial of service (IXFR client crash) via a large IXFR response and allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (primary DNS server crash) via a large UPDATE message.
CVE-2010-0290 - Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.3.x, 9.4 before 9.4.3-P5, 9.5 before 9.5.2-P2, 9.6 before 9.6.1-P3, and 9.7.0 beta, with DNSSEC validation enabled and checking disabled (CD), allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning attacks by receiving a recursive client query and sending a response that contains (1) CNAME or (2) DNAME records, which do not have the intended validation before caching, aka Bug 20737. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-4022.
CVE-2009-4022 - Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.3.x, 9.4 before 9.4.3-P4, 9.5 before 9.5.2-P1, 9.6 before 9.6.1-P2, and 9.7 beta before 9.7.0b3, with DNSSEC validation enabled and checking disabled (CD), allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning attacks by receiving a recursive client query and sending a response that contains an Additional section with crafted data, which is not properly handled when the response is processed “at the same time as requesting DNSSEC records (DO),” aka Bug 20438.
CVE-2022-2795 - By flooding the target resolver with queries exploiting this flaw an attacker can significantly impair the resolver’s performance, effectively denying legitimate clients access to the DNS resolution service.

Port 80 vulnerabilities for Apache httpd 2.2.8 ((Ubuntu) DAV/2)
CVE-2011-3192 - The byterange filter in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a Range header that expresses multiple overlapping ranges, as exploited in the wild in August 2011, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-0086.
CVE-2017-7679 - In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_mime can read one byte past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type response header.
CVE-2017-3167 - In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed.
CVE-2009-1891 - The mod_deflate module in Apache httpd 2.2.11 and earlier compresses large files until completion even after the associated network connection is closed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption). 
CVE-2009-1890 - The stream_reqbody_cl function in mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.3.3, when a reverse proxy is configured, does not properly handle an amount of streamed data that exceeds the Content-Length value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted requests.
CVE-2012-0883 - envvars (aka envvars-std) in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.2 places a zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DSO in the current working directory during execution of apachectl.
CVE-2016-5387 - The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application’s outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an “httpoxy” issue. NOTE: the vendor states "This mitigation has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.
CVE-2014-0226 - Race condition in the mod_status module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow), or possibly obtain sensitive credential information or execute arbitrary code, via a crafted request that triggers improper scoreboard handling within the status_handler function in modules/generators/mod_status.c and the lua_ap_scoreboard_worker function in modules/lua/lua_request.c.
CVE-2017-9788 - In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type ‘Digest’ was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no ‘=’ assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.
CVE-2009-3555 - The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.12.4 and earlier, multiple Cisco products, and other products, does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to a “plaintext injection” attack, aka the “Project Mogul” issue. 
CVE-2013-1862 - mod_rewrite.c in the mod_rewrite module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.25 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.
CVE-2017-9798 - Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user’s .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
CVE-2016-8743 - Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.
CVE-2014-0231 - The mod_cgid module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10 does not have a timeout mechanism, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process hang) via a request to a CGI script that does not read from its stdin file descriptor.
CVE-2014-0098 - The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and daemon crash) via a crafted cookie that is not properly handled during truncation.
CVE-2013-6438 - The dav_xml_get_cdata function in main/util.c in the mod_dav module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.8 does not properly remove whitespace characters from CDATA sections, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted DAV WRITE request.
CVE-2013-5704 - The mod_headers module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.22 allows remote attackers to bypass “RequestHeader unset” directives by placing a header in the trailer portion of data sent with chunked transfer coding. NOTE: the vendor states “this is not a security issue in httpd as such.”
CVE-2011-3368 - The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character.
CVE-2010-1452 - The (1) mod_cache and (2) mod_dav modules in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.16 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via a request that lacks a path.
CVE-2010-0408 - The ap_proxy_ajp_request function in mod_proxy_ajp.c in mod_proxy_ajp in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15 does not properly handle certain situations in which a client sends no request body, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (backend server outage) via a crafted request, related to use of a 500 error code instead of the appropriate 400 error code.
CVE-2009-3095 - The mod_proxy_ftp module in the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and send arbitrary commands to an FTP server via vectors related to the embedding of these commands in the Authorization HTTP header, as demonstrated by a certain module in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.11.
CVE-2009-2699 - The Solaris pollset feature in the Event Port backend in poll/unix/port.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.3.9, as used in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.14 and other products, does not properly handle errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon hang) via unspecified HTTP requests, related to the prefork and event MPMs.

CVE-2007-6750 - The Apache HTTP Server 1.x and 2.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) via partial HTTP requests, as demonstrated by Slowloris, related to the lack of the mod_reqtimeout module in versions before 2.2.15. 
CVE-2009-1195 - The Apache HTTP Server 2.2.11 and earlier 2.2 versions does not properly handle Options=IncludesNOEXEC in the AllowOverride directive, which allows local users to gain privileges by configuring (1) Options Includes, (2) Options +Includes, or (3) Options +IncludesNOEXEC in a .htaccess file, and then inserting an exec element in a .shtml file.
CVE-2012-0031 - scoreboard.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.21 and earlier might allow local users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash during shutdown) or possibly have unspecified other impact by modifying a certain type field within a scoreboard shared memory segment, leading to an invalid call to the free function.
CVE-2011-3607 - Integer overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. 
CVE-2016-4975 - Possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting attacks for sites which use mod_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes made in 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 which prohibit CR or LF injection into the “Location” or other outbound header key or value. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 (Affected 2.4.1-2.4.23). Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.32 (Affected 2.2.0-2.2.31). 
CVE-2014-0118 - The deflate_in_filter function in mod_deflate.c in the mod_deflate module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.10, when request body decompression is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via crafted request data that decompresses to a much larger size. 
CVE-2013-1896 - mod_dav.c in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.25 does not properly determine whether DAV is enabled for a URI, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a MERGE request in which the URI is configured for handling by the mod_dav_svn module, but a certain href attribute in XML data refers to a non-DAV URI.

CVE-2012-3499 - Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving hostnames and URIs in the (1) mod_imagemap, (2) mod_info, (3) mod_ldap, (4) mod_proxy_ftp, and (5) mod_status modules.
CVE-2012-0053 - protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.
CVE-2011-4317 - The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an @ (at sign) character and a : (colon) character in invalid positions. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.
CVE-2011-3639 - The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x before 2.2.18, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers by using the HTTP/0.9 protocol with a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.
CVE-2011-0419 - Stack consumption vulnerability in the fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.4.3 and the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.18, and in fnmatch.c in libc in NetBSD 5.1, OpenBSD 4.8, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X 10.6, Oracle Solaris 10, and Android, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via *? sequences in the first argument, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd.
CVE-2010-0434 - The ap_read_request function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15, when a multithreaded MPM is used, does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances involving a parent request that has a body, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated with an earlier request.
CVE-2008-2939 - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in proxy_ftp.c in the mod_proxy_ftp module in Apache 2.0.63 and earlier, and mod_proxy_ftp.c in the mod_proxy_ftp module in Apache 2.2.9 and earlier 2.2 versions, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a wildcard in the last directory component in the pathname in an FTP URI.
CVE-2008-0455 - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by uploading a file with a name containing XSS sequences and a file extension, which leads to injection within a (1) “406 Not Acceptable” or (2) “300 Multiple Choices” HTTP response when the extension is omitted in a request for the file.
CVE-2008-0005 - mod_proxy_ftp in Apache 2.2.x before 2.2.7-dev, 2.0.x before 2.0.62-dev, and 1.3.x before 1.3.40-dev does not define a charset, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks using UTF-7 encoding.
CVE-2012-2687 - Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the make_variant_list function in mod_negotiation.c in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.3, when the MultiViews option is enabled, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted filename that is not properly handled during construction of a variant list.
CVE-2009-3094 - The ap_proxy_ftp_handler function in modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c in the mod_proxy_ftp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.63 and 2.2.13 allows remote FTP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and child process crash) via a malformed reply to an EPSV command.
CVE-2008-0456 - CRLF injection vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks by uploading a file with a multi-line name containing HTTP header sequences and a file extension, which leads to injection within a (1) “406 Not Acceptable” or (2) “300 Multiple Choices” HTTP response when the extension is omitted in a request for the file.
CVE-2011-4415 - The ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, does not restrict the size of values of environment variables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or NULL pointer dereference) via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, related to (1) the “len +=” statement and (2) the apr_pcalloc function call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3607.
